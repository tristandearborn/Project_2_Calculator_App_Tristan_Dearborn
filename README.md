# Calculator Project

This is a calcultor made in Android Studio with Kotlin. You type in digits then click what operation you would like with them, and the calculation should be completed.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User sees an interface with numbers 0-9, and different operations.
* [ ] User can click on each button to display what was clicked on the screen.
* [ ] User can clear the screen with the C operation.
* [ ] User can click the equals operation to complete the calculations.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* User can rotate device and get a rotated interface with 4 new buttons.
* User can use + operation to add, - operation to subtract, X operation to multiply, and / operation to divide.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

In my last version, I was not able to get the calculator to preform correct operations, as the math was incorrect in the functions, but I have corrected that. All operations are now possible.
